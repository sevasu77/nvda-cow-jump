🐄 NVDA Cow Jump
The world's first "Stock Market-Linked Cow Physics" game.

💡 Concept: The Semiconductor Meta-Causality
"Why is a cow powered by NVIDIA (NVDA) carrying an ASML financial report on its back?"

Because in the modern semiconductor ecosystem, there is a brutal truth: "If ASML trips, NVIDIA cannot jump." In this game, the cow's jumping power (propulsion) is entirely dependent on NVIDIA's stock price fluctuations. However, the technical foundation supporting its feet is concentrated in the ASML "chip" (QR code) on its back. This represents the delicate balance of the global supply chain.

🕹️ Game Mechanics
Real-time Gravity: When NVIDIA's stock rises, gravity decreases. When it crashes, the cow is slammed to the ground by the weight of market despair.

Dynamic MOO-Synth: A "Moo" sound synthesized from scratch via JavaScript. It becomes light and melodic when the market is positive, but turns into a deep, haunting bass from the depths of hell when the market is negative.

Analysis Mode: The market never stops, but this game does. Press [P] to pause. The microchip (QR code) on the cow's back scales up, allowing players to scan and read ASML's IR reports to escape from the reality of price action.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript (Web Audio API for Synthesizer)

Backend: Python, Streamlit

Data Source: yfinance (Real-time stock data)

Library: qrcode.js

🏃 Quick Start

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nvda-cow-jump.git

# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit yfinance

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
⚠️ Warning
Playing this game during a market crash is not recommended for your mental health. If the cow feels too heavy to jump, it might be a sign from the universe—and the market—telling you it's time to "Cut Loss" (Stop Loss). Play at your own financial risk.



🐄 NVDA Cow Jump
The world's first "Stock Market-Linked Cow Physics" game.

💡 Concept: The Semiconductor Meta-Causality
なぜ、NVIDIA (NVDA) の株価で動いているのに、牛は ASML の決算書（QRコード）を背負っているのか？

それは、現代の半導体エコシステムにおいて 「ASMLがコケれば、NVIDIAも跳べない」 という残酷な真理を表現しているからです。このゲームにおいて、牛のジャンプ力（動力）はNVIDIAの株価騰落率に依存し、その足場を支える技術的根拠は背中のASMLチップに集約されています。

🕹️ Game Mechanics
Real-time Gravity: NVIDIAの株価が上がれば重力は軽くなり、暴落すれば牛は自らの重みと市場の絶望で地面に叩きつけられます。

Dynamic MOO-Synth: JavaScriptでゼロから合成された「モー」という鳴き声。株価がポジティブなら軽やかに、ネガティブなら地獄の底から響くような低音に変化します。

Analysis Mode: 市場は一瞬も止まりませんが、このゲームは [P] キーで止まります。一時停止中、牛の背中のマイクロチップ（QRコード）が巨大化し、プレイヤーはASMLのIR資料（決算書）をスキャンして現実逃避することが可能です。

⚠️ Warning
株価暴落時にこのゲームをプレイすることは、精神衛生上おすすめしません。牛が重くて跳ねない時、それは現実の市場があなたに「ロスカット」を促しているサインかもしれません。
